A text cipher invented by yours truly

If you wish to encrypt some text make sure to create a text file in the same folder as the main.py script.
Type the name of the file you wish to encrypt then the name of a file you'd like to save it too.

The Mult variable is the difficulty setting for the program 1 is basic encryption higher than one and the files can get quite large and incredibly difficult to decipher without my decrypter.
